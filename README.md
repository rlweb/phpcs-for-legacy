### PHPCS for Legacy codebases

Can't get a monolitic code base up to scratch but would like slow incremental progress. PHPCS for legacy allows new standards to be implemented incrementally, by only enforcing them on new / edited code via checking the `git diff`.

## Install

With composer simply `composer require -dev rlweb/phpcs-for-legacy`.
